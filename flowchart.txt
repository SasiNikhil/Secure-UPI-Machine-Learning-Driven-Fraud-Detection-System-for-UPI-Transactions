WithoutKNN-Imputer
-------------------
1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset 
	- Diabetes data
3. Data Processing
	- Removing Duplicate Data
	- Drop Cleaning  
4. EDA of Data
	- Correlation Matrix
	- Sample Outcome
5. Feature Selection 
	- Selecting the X and y  Data 
	- Spliting the Dataset to train and test
6. Building the model 
	
	- Logistic Regression
	- Decision Tree
	- XGBoost
	- SVM
        - KNN
	- Naive Bayes
	- Voting Classifier (Decision Tree + XGBoost + KNN + ExtraTree) 
	- Stacking Classifier (BaggingClassifier with RF as extimation + DT with LightGBM as Estimator for Stacking )
7. Training and Building the model
8. Comapring the models with accuracy, precision, recall, f1score
9. Comparison graph are generated with score of all models.
10. Save the model 

11. Frontend is developed with help of Flask Framework, along with Registration and Login setup with support of Sqlite3DB
12. User gives input as Feature Values 
13. The given input is preprocessed for prediction
14. Trained model is used for prediction
15. Final outcome is displayed through frontend


Extension
----------
In the base paper the author mentioned to use upi fraud dataset using XGBoost
compare with other models, from which proposed model got 98.2 of accuracy respectively,
As an extension we applied an ensemble method  combining the predictions of multiple individual models to produce a more robust and accurate final prediction. 
However, we can further enhance the performance by exploring other ensemble techniques such as Stacking Classifier which got 99.4 of accuracy,
As an extension we can build the front end using the flask framework for user testing and with user authentication.
